## What is Lexicon?
Everyone finds hyperniche stuff on the internet that they love, these things are highly peculiar and may not find the best platforms to be expressed. 

This is what Lexicon does, it's an open-sourced repository of "Cool Stuff from the Internet" - tweets, videos, explanations, songs, games, blog writings, a cool image, a meme, pretty much anything. Think of it like a platform to showcase your musings that wouldn't make it to a "nOrMaL" conversation otherwise, SFW obviously ;).
